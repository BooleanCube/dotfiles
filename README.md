# dotfiles
These are my dotfiles and configurations for applications I use.

I don't actually use i3 however, I do have my old i3-gaps config on here. I currently use a gnome extension tiling manager called pop shell which works splendidly! I used Material Shell WM before but I didn't have a nice experience with it because it was very buggy.

### Example:

**Material Shell WM**
