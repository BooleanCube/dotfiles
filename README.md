# dotfiles
These are my dotfiles and configurations for applications I use.

Refer back to my [old dotfiles](https://github.com/BooleanCube/old-dotfiles) for more cool stuff that I have customized

I don't actually use i3 however, I do have my old i3-gaps config on here. I currently use a gnome extension window manager called material shell which works splendidly!

### Example:

**Material Shell WM**
